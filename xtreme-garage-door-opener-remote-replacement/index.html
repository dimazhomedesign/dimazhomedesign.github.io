<p><strong>Xtreme Garage Door Opener Remote Replacement</strong>. You can repair a LiftMaster model 1345 or 1355 garage door opener with this replacement circuit board 41A5021-1H-315. We used the six inch to make up about a 2 inch gap tapered to zero over a ten foot distance but I am fairly sure the same gasket will work in your case. Going with the 4 or 6 inch gasket does not change the width at the bottom of the door only the depth or the gasket. I just replaced the vinyl seal on my garage door for the exact same reason.</p>

<p>Its a less-expensive and less time-consuming option to get your door working properly again. You can repair a LiftMaster model 1345 or 1355 garage door opener with this replacement circuit board 41A5021-1H-315. Going with the 4 or 6 inch gasket does not change the width at the bottom of the door only the depth or the gasket. We used the six inch to make up about a 2 inch gap tapered to zero over a ten foot distance but I am fairly sure the same gasket will work in your case.
