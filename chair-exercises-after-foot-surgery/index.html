<p>Sit on the edge of a chair. You may think you have everything you need to buy before a knee replacement like a grab bar or a sock aid or maybe you even purchased a knee kitBut youre not done preparing yet. Sit in a chair and place your heel on another chair of equal height. This stretches and relaxes the ligaments around your ankle. 10 reps 2x per day.</p>

Mimi had an osteotomy bunionectomy with removal of the arthritis and correction of the bunion deformity all at once. Surgery corrected the knee problem.</p>
