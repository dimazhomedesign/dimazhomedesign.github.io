Load-bearing ca-pacity drainage crack control life-cycle cost constructibility and maintainability are other characteristics that are important in the design and construction of concrete. Prefixes are mainly used to identify components of a bearing. A bearing is a machine element that constrains relative motion to only the desired motion and reduces friction between moving partsThe design of the bearing may for example provide for free linear movement of the moving part or for free rotation around a fixed axis.</p>
