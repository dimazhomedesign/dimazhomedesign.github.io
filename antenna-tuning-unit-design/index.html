<p>Antenna Tuning Unit - Receive Only Description. 1 a single long wire using ground as the counterpoise and 2 a balanced antenna of some kind. The transmatch or ham radio antenna tuner is a variable impedance matching device. Specifically the paper is concerned with applying these methods to design an antenna tuning unit providing the facility to adapt to changes in load impedance temperature or. Tuning capacitor plate spacing of at least 002 inch would seem necessary to operate 400 W PEP and for this spacing suitable capacitors above 200 to 240 pF are difficult to find.</p>
