<p><strong>Aircraft Wing Design Calculations</strong>. This course also will review the mathematics needed in the aviation industry for unit conversions and calculations. Building a lighter wing with better lift-to-drag ratio than would be possible in the case of an overall design with a simple high lift system. First lets take a look at the different parts of the RC airplane and then we will start the RC Plane design calculations.

A scale model of the Flying-V an experimental aircraft design with huge wings took flight recently in Germany. Of all the nations Germany was the first to begin to make significant use of jet aircraft although these nevertheless came too late in the war and in insufficient quantity to have a decisive effect on the course of the air war. The blended-wing aircraft concept is. In designing the wing of an airplane several fluid dynamic concepts come into play.</p>

<p>Creating a process map is the first step towards designing and building a new aircraft. This is a deliberate design as it means that any time the aircrafts nose pitches up the wing will provide a restorative moment that will tend to bring the nose back down.
