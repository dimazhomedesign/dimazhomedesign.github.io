<p><strong>Chair Conformational Isomers</strong>. This tutorial will give you a detailed understand of when and how to use each of these isomers in your organic chemistry course. The chair form and the boat forms are extreme cases. For example the two chair forms of cis-12-dimethylcyclohexane are actually enantiomers but since they interconvert so quickly at room temperature they are treated as if they are the same. Conformational isomers exist in a dynamic equilibrium where the relative free energies of isomers determines the population of each isomer and the energy barrier of rotation determines the rate of interconversion between isomers.</p>

<p>Last time we covered a comparatively simple reaction. Lets first talk about conformationsThese also referred to as conformers or conformational isomers are different arrangements of atoms that occur as a result of rotation about single bondsFor example in the following molecule we can have a different arrangement of atoms by rotating around the middle σ bond. Generally we make the assumption that conformational isomers interconvert quickly on the timescale necessary to measure optical rotation. An energy diagram for these conformational interconversions is drawn below.

<p>An energy diagram for these conformational interconversions is drawn below. In conformational isomerism because of the free rotation of carbon-carbon single bond different arrangement of atoms in space are obtained. Where K is the equilibrium constant ΔG is the difference in standard free energy between the two conformers in kcalmol R is the universal. Conformational isomers or conformers or rotational isomers or rotamers are stereoisomers produced by rotation twisting about σ bonds and are often rapidly interconverting at room temperature. A facile twist-boat TB-boat B equilibrium intervenes as one chair conformer C changes to the other.</p>

<p>Last time we covered a comparatively simple reaction. The activation energy for the chair-chair conversion is due chiefly to a high energy twist-chair form TC in which significant angle and eclipsing strain are present. For example the two chair forms of cis-12-dimethylcyclohexane are actually enantiomers but since they interconvert so quickly at room temperature they are treated as if they are the same.

<p>Conformational isomers exist in a dynamic equilibrium where the relative free energies of isomers determines the population of each isomer and the energy barrier of rotation determines the rate of interconversion between isomers. From understanding geometric isomers to naming molecules with Cis Trans or EZ and lots of practice examples to ensure the concept. If the energy barrier between two conformational isomers is low enough it may be overcome by the random inputs of thermal energy that the molecule gets from interactions with the environment or from its own vibrations. Cis vs Trans Isomers and E vs Z Isomers. Where K is the equilibrium constant ΔG is the difference in standard free energy between the two conformers in kcalmol R is the universal.</p>
