<p>ROAD DESIGN CHAPTER 3 INDEX ALIGNMENT AND GEOMETRICS 301 REFERENCES 302 DEFINITION OF TERMS 303 ALIGNMENT - GENERAL A. Minimum length of 30m Minimum length of 30 m. Design elements that affect roadside safety include horizontal alignment and superelevation vertical alignment drainage design sight distance lane widths pavement and markings cross slopes. This page gives a brief description of each section by roadway classification. For general use in design of a horizontal curve the sight line is a chord of the curve and the horizontal stopping sight distance is measured along the centerline of the inside lane around the curve See Figure 3-23 2011 AASHTO 3-106 The following equation applies only to.</p>
