<p>Level says that the battery on this device will last around 1 year and it only needs 1 lithium CR2 battery which is small and very easy to replace.

Regardless of your particular door latch issue you need to find an answer to have your door operating properly again. I purchased a house with a ton of Vivint hardware installed 3 outdoor cams 1 indoor cam doorbell cam skypanel and 2 motion detectors and a ton of windowdoor sensors.</p>
