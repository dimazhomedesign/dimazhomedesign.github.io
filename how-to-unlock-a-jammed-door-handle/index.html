<p>After the sleep command the driver door antenna turns on so that it can detect a fob on the outside of the driver door. The issue has nothing to do with the control of the doorknob or with the door itself. Other issues such as detached bolt work or jammed internals can be assessed when you try to move the safe handle to unlock the device. Our mobile window and door repair service is available throughout the area including in Plymstock Plympton Ivybridge and Tavistock. Swing the interior door lock assembly out of the way.</p>
