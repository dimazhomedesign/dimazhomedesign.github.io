<p>Say you have a query that involves a view and that view is comprised of 10 tables joined together. This model can consist of multiple parent segments and these segments are grouped as levels but there exists a logical association between the segments belonging to any level. Data Definition Language DDL is a query fired to create database schema tables mappings etc in the database. ArangoDB has been referred to as a universal database but its creators refer to it as a native multi-model database to indicate that it was designed. A data model determining fundamentally how data can be stored manipulated and organised and the structure of the database logically is called database model.</p>
